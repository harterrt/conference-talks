# Conference Talks

This repository includes supplementary material 
to support my Data Science conference talks.

Currently, this only includes my upcoming talk at Vermont Code Camp '19
titled, "Common Sense Stats - Bootstrapping".
I expect to eventually fold in the supplementary material from:
[When the Bootstrap Breaks](https://github.com/harterrt/when_the_bootstrap_breaks)
