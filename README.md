# Conference Talks

This repository includes supplementary material 
to support my conference presentations around Data Science.

Currently, this only includes my upcoming talk at 
[Vermont Code Camp 11](https://www.vtcodecamp.org/)
titled, "Common Sense Stats - Bootstrapping".
I expect to eventually fold in the supplementary material from:
[When the Bootstrap Breaks](https://github.com/harterrt/when_the_bootstrap_breaks).
